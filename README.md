# Trajectory-Tracking-Using-TurtleBot3-Mobile-Robot
This GitHub repository is dedicated to a robotics project that explores the application of PID controllers for trajectory tracking using the TurtleBot3. It includes experiments and documentation on navigating predefined paths with optimized PID parameters, leveraging ROS for real-time control.

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a trajectory-tracking robot project using the TurtleBot3 platform. The project aims to demonstrate the application of a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller in guiding a mobile robot along predefined trajectories such as lines, circles, sine waves, and lemniscates. We have tuned PID parameters by leveraging the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform to achieve optimal tracking performance.

# Project Objectives
* To explore the effectiveness of PID controllers in trajectory tracking for mobile robots.
* To experiment with different PID parameter tunings for various trajectory shapes.
* To address the challenge of accurate orientation tracking using odometry sensors and computational methods.
